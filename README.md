# statusbot

statusbot is a chat bot built on the [Probot][probot] framework. A wiki is available [here][wiki].

This README will help you get started. It will be updated and improved
to discuss user-specific instances, usage and deployment, the functionality 
available, and more!

## What does the bot do?

- Background management in GitHub:
  - Assign new PRs to the `Pipeline for QA` project board (`REVIEW` column).
  - Move existing PRs to the correct `Pipeline for QA` project board column (`REVIEW`/`IN TEST`), depending on whether or not the required conditions are met: is mergeable, at least two reviewers have approved it, and there is no request for changes.
  - Assign issues that are labeled `bounty-awaiting-approval` to the `Status SOB Swarm` project board (`bounty-awaiting-approval` column).
  - Welcome users who post their first PR in a project.
  - Check whether all commits are GPG signed, and set the PR status accordingly.
  - Unfurl links on Issues and Pull Request discussions.
  - Disallow merging of PRs containing WIP in the title.
  - Mention repo collaborators on Slack when a GHI is assigned the `bounty-awaiting-approval` label.
  - After a PR is moved to the IN TEST column and the build has passed successfully, the bot will kick a test automation build in Jenkins (retry periodically if the PR build is still running).
  - New functionality will be added in the future, and the wishlist is being tracked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19NZEJ453av-owAEBXcIPjavbGKMBFlfVcwsuQ_ORzR4/)).

The project board's names, column names, welcome message, and other values are stored in the `.github/github-bot.yml` file. It can be overriden for each specific repository by adding a file in the same path on the respective repository (see [probot-config](https://github.com/getsentry/probot-config)).

## Development

To get your environment set up, go through the following steps:

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Populate `.env`.

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env file to contain proper config
   ```

After this, you can start the bot by running the following:
```sh
npm start
```

## Creating the Slack Bot Integration

1. Go to https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot.
2. Add a bot integration.
3. Note the bot token starting with `xoxb-`, and put it into `.env`.

## Creating the bot GitHub App

This bot is meant to be packaged as a GitHub App. There are two steps to it: creating the app, and installing the app. The app needs to be created only once and can be made public and reused for any number of repositories and organizations.

See the official [docs for deployment](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).

1. Create the GitHub App:
    1. In GitHub, go to `Settings/Developer settings/GitHub Apps` and click on `New GitHub App`
    1. Enter the bot name in `GitHub App name`, e.g. `Status GitHub Bot`
    1. In `Homepage URL`, enter the `/ping` endpoint of the service, e.g. https://5e63b0ab.ngrok.io/ping
    1. In `Webhook URL`, enter the root endpoint of the service, e.g. https://5e63b0ab.ngrok.io/
    1. In `Webhook secret (optional)`, enter a string of characters that matches the value passed in the in the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable.
    1. This app requires these **Permissions & events** for the GitHub App:
        - Commit statuses - **Read & write**
        - Issues - **Read & Write**
            - [x] Check the box for **Issue comment** events
            - [x] Check the box for **Issues** events

            - [x] Check the box for **Pull request review comment** events
        - Repository contents - **Read-only**
            - [x] Check the box for **Push** events
        - Repository projects - **Read & Write**
            - [x] Check the box for **Project for repository projects** events
            - [x] Check the box for **Project card for repository projects** events
        - Organization projects - **Read-only**
            - [x] Check the box for **Project for organization projects** events
        - Single File - **Read-only**
            - Path: `.github/github-bot.yml`
    1. üîç  Verify that you have **ticked 9 boxes**.
    1. Generate a private key pass and save it.
1. Installing the bot service:
    1. Deploy the bot to the cloud.
    1. Set the `APP_ID` environment variable to value reported when the GitHub App was created.
    1. Set the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable to the value configured in the GitHub App.
    1. Set the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable to the contents of the `.pem` file.
    1. Set the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable to the value reported for the bot in [Slack](https://status-im.slack.com/apps/).
1. Install the GitHub App in an account:
    1. Select the repositories where the bot should work (e.g. `status-react`).

## Customizing the bot

The bot gets its settings from a per-repo file located at `.github/github-bot.yml`. That file extends the [base file](https://github.com/status-im/probot-settings/blob/master/.github/github-bot.yml) at the status-im/probot-settings repo.

Examples of settings that can be configured:

- `github-team/slug`: Slug of the team that owns the respective repository
- `welcome-bot/message-template`: First time contributor welcome message template. Examples of template values allowed:

  - `{user}`: Replaced by the PR submitter's user name
  - `{repo-name}`: Replaced by the PR's target repository name
  - `{pr-number}`: Replaced by the PR number

- `slack/notification/room`: Slack room used for notifications (e.g. `status-probot`)

  - `project-board/contributor-column-name`: Name of the column in the project board to group issues that are being worked on by a contributor
  - `project-board/review-column-name`: Name of the column in the project board to group issues that are up for review
  - `project-board/test-column-name`: Name of the column in the project board to group issues that up for testing by QA

- Bounty project board settings:

  - `bounty-project-board/name`: Name of the bounty project board in GitHub
  - `bounty-project-board/owner`: GitHub username of the maintainer of the bounty project board (used to e.g. send Slack notifications)
  - `bounty-project-board/awaiting-approval-column-name`: Name of the column in the bounty project board to group issues that are awaiting for bounty approval
  - `bounty-project-board/awaiting-approval-label-name`: Name of the label used in issues to declare that an issue is awaiting approval to become a bounty
  - `bounty-project-board/bounty-label-name`: Name of the label used in issues to declare that an issue is a bounty
  - `bounty-project-board/bounty-size-label-name-regex`: Regular expression that matches the bounty size label and returns a group containing the size itself
  - `bounty-project-board/post-approved-bounties-to-slack-room`: Name of the Slack room where to cross-post approved bounties 

- Automated tests settings:
  - `automated-tests/repo-full-name`: Full name of the repo to watch in project cards in order to automatically run automated tests CI job (e.g. `status-im/status-react`)
  - `automated-tests/job-full-name`: Full name of the CI job to run automated tests (e.g. `end-to-end-tests/status-app-end-to-end-tests`)

## Restart the bot

You may want to get comfortable with `heroku logs` and `heroku restart` if
you're having issues.
